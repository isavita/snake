I want to build Snake game with your help. Here is my initial plan of how we can do that
A detailed breakdown of the task to create the Snake game with multiple scenes using Phaser 3 JavaScript library for mobile devices. Here's how you can approach this project:

1. **Project Setup**:
   - Set up a new Phaser 3 project or use an existing starter template.
   - Configure the game canvas to fit the standard iPhone 13 screen size or larger (e.g., 1170x2532 pixels) and ensure that the game is responsive for different screen sizes.
   - Create separate files for each scene (SplashScene, MenuScene, GameScene, and ScoreScene).

2. **SplashScene**:
   - Create a simple scene that displays a splash screen or logo.
   - Set a timeout of 500ms using `this.time.delayedCall(500, () => { /* Transition to MenuScene */ })`.
   - Transition to the MenuScene after the delay.

3. **MenuScene**:
   - Create a scene with a background image or a stylized menu design.
   - Add two buttons: "Start Game" and "Scores".
   - Implement button click events using Phaser's input system.
   - On "Start Game" button click, transition to the GameScene.
   - On "Scores" button click, transition to the ScoreScene.

4. **GameScene**:
   - Set up the game board with appropriate dimensions and a background.
   - Create the snake object with an initial length and position.
   - Implement snake movement using keyboard input or touch controls for mobile devices.
   - Generate food items randomly on the game board.
   - Handle snake collision with food items (increase length and update score).
   - Implement game over conditions (e.g., snake colliding with walls or itself).
   - Display the current score on the screen.
   - Store the player's score in local storage or a database (if you want to persist scores).
   - Add a "Back to Menu" button or touch control to return to the MenuScene.

5. **ScoreScene**:
   - Retrieve the top 5 scores from local storage or a database.
   - Display the top 5 scores on the screen in a visually appealing way.
   - Add a "Back to Menu" button or touch control to return to the MenuScene.

6. **Scene Management**:
   - Create a centralized scene manager to handle scene transitions and state management.
   - Use Phaser's scene management system to load, start, and stop scenes as needed.

7. **Asset Management**:
   - Create or obtain necessary assets (images, sounds, etc.) for the game.
   - Load and manage assets using Phaser's asset loader.

8. **Mobile Optimization**:
   - Ensure that the game is optimized for mobile devices by considering performance, touch controls, and screen size adaptability.
   - Test the game on various Android and iOS devices to ensure compatibility and smooth gameplay.

9. **Deployment**:
   - Build the game for web deployment or package it as a mobile app using tools like Capacitor or Cordova (if desired).

10. **Testing and Debugging**:
    - Thoroughly test the game on different devices and screen sizes.
    - Debug any issues that arise during development and deployment.

What do you think for this plan? Before we start let's laydown the structure of the project and how we will store it on github etc.

Your plan for creating a Snake game using Phaser 3 is well-structured and covers all essential aspects of the project. Here’s how we can further break down the structure of the project, set up the repository on GitHub, and get started with the development:

### Project Structure
The project will have a clear and organized structure with separate directories for assets, scenes, and utility functions. Here’s a suggested directory structure:

```
snake-game/
├── assets/
│   ├── images/
│   ├── sounds/
├── scenes/
│   ├── SplashScene.js
│   ├── MenuScene.js
│   ├── GameScene.js
│   ├── ScoreScene.js
├── utils/
│   ├── SceneManager.js
│   ├── LocalStorageManager.js
├── index.html
├── main.js
├── phaser-config.js
├── styles.css
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

### GitHub Repository Setup
1. **Create a GitHub Repository:**
   - Go to GitHub and create a new repository named `snake-game`.
   - Initialize it with a README.md file and optionally a .gitignore file for Node.js projects.

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game.git
   cd snake-game
   ```

3. **Initialize the Project:**
   - Set up your project directory as per the structure mentioned above.
   - Initialize npm in the project directory:
     ```bash
     npm init -y
     ```
   - Install Phaser 3:
     ```bash
     npm install phaser
     ```

4. **Basic Files Setup:**
   - Create the `index.html` file to load the game:
     ```html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html lang="en">
     <head>
         <meta charset="UTF-8">
         <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
         <title>Snake Game</title>
         <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
     </head>
     <body>
         <script src="main.js"></script>
     </body>
     </html>
     ```

   - Create the `main.js` file to initialize the Phaser game:
     ```javascript
     import Phaser from 'phaser';
     import PhaserConfig from './phaser-config';

     window.onload = () => {
         new Phaser.Game(PhaserConfig);
     };
     ```

   - Create the `phaser-config.js` file for game configuration:
     ```javascript
     import SplashScene from './scenes/SplashScene';
     import MenuScene from './scenes/MenuScene';
     import GameScene from './scenes/GameScene';
     import ScoreScene from './scenes/ScoreScene';

     export default {
         type: Phaser.AUTO,
         width: 1170,
         height: 2532,
         scene: [SplashScene, MenuScene, GameScene, ScoreScene],
         physics: {
             default: 'arcade',
             arcade: {
                 debug: false
             }
         }
     };
     ```

   - Create basic scene files in the `scenes` directory, e.g., `SplashScene.js`:
     ```javascript
     import Phaser from 'phaser';

     class SplashScene extends Phaser.Scene {
         constructor() {
             super({ key: 'SplashScene' });
         }

         preload() {
             // Load assets here
         }

         create() {
             // Create splash screen
             this.time.delayedCall(500, () => {
                 this.scene.start('MenuScene');
             });
         }
     }

     export default SplashScene;
     ```

5. **Create Utility Files:**
   - Create utility files for scene management and local storage handling in the `utils` directory.

6. **Commit and Push:**
   - Add and commit your changes:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial project setup with basic structure and Phaser configuration"
     ```
   - Push the changes to GitHub:
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```

### Development Steps
Now that the project structure and initial setup are in place, you can start developing each scene and the game's functionality as per your plan:

1. **SplashScene**: Implement the splash screen transition.
2. **MenuScene**: Create the menu with buttons and handle button click events.
3. **GameScene**: Develop the core game mechanics (snake movement, collision, food generation, score handling).
4. **ScoreScene**: Implement score retrieval and display.
5. **Scene Management**: Ensure smooth transitions and state management between scenes.
6. **Asset Management**: Load and manage game assets efficiently.
7. **Mobile Optimization**: Test and optimize for various mobile devices.
8. **Deployment**: Prepare the game for deployment, either as a web application or a mobile app.

Each of these steps can be committed to the repository incrementally, ensuring version control and collaborative development if needed.
